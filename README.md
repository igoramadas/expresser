A Node.js framework built on top of Express.

## Why Expresser?

Building on top of Express with added logging, utilities and extra plugins. The idea of Expresser is to aggregate
all these common modules and utilities into a single package, making it damn easy to create your new Node.js app.

### Use Expresser if...

* You're new to Node.js web apps
* You're familiar with Express.js
* You want to use a similar codebase on your Node.js apps

### Look elsewhere if...

* You hate Express.js
* You hate TypeScript
* You need ultimate performance and as little overhead as possible

## New version 4

Expresser is being rebuilt! CoffeeScript gives way to TypeScript. All-in-one gives way to only-what-you-need.
